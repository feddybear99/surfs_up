**Module 9: Surfs_up**


**Overview of the statistical analysis:**

W. Avy is passionate about Oahu being the prime locationâ€”he's convinced that it will provide the best weather for surfing and eating ice cream. Before he takes his proposal to the board of directors, he'd like a visualization of the results. To do this, my job is to plot the results of the analysis so that he can share a visual presentation with the board if needed, and convince them to invest in my shop.

First, we need to create a plot that shows all of the temperatures in a given year for the station with the highest number of temperature observations. For our most active station, we'll need to find the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures. The months June & December are ones that we're focused on analyzing because June (historically) is a summer/hot temperature month and December (historically) is a winter/cooler temperature month. My goal is to provide the weather statistics to W. Avy so he can help support his shop location proposal. 


**Results:**

*June Precipitation Results*

*December Precipitation Results*

The results show that both temperature statistics 6-months apart have roughly the same weather temperatures. 

- The average temperature for both June & December is in the 70s (Fahrenheit)
- June & December also have similar minimum/maximum temperatures
- The takeaway is that the temperature is constant from a summer month compared to a winter month. 



The temperature in Oahu is relatively the same throughout the year and chances of continuous rainfall is low. I would be more interested in seeing a 12-month aggregated data set showcasing temperature, humidity, visibility, wind, precipitation, UV index, and air quality index. Since Hawaii is an active volcano, I think it's worth measuring its air quality index and UV index, especially since global warming exists and temperatures continue to rise. Would people continue going to Hawaii as a vacation spot if the temperatures get too hot? That's something to look into.
